Vue SSR With Webpack 4 & Vue Loader 15
======================================

This repo serves as an example for those attempting to utilize Vue server-server side rendering (SSR) with the latest versions of Webpack and Vue Loader. 

## Setup

### Install Dependencies

First, ensure you're using a version of Node.js compatible with this project, which at the time of writing is `v8.11.1`. For [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) users, I've provided an `.nvmrc` file set to this version.

Once you've properly configured Node.js, install necessary dependencies using either 

`yarn` 

or

`npm install`

### Build

Run `webpack` to generate both the server and client-side bundles.

### Serve

Run `npm start` to start a local server listening on port `8070`.
